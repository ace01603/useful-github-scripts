# Useful GitHub scripts for teaching
File contents (will need some editing before use):
- github.py - a library of functions for automating aspects of creating a GitHub organisation for teaching. 
- copy_practical_templates.py - run this to copy all template repos from one GiHub organisation to another.
- clone_and_make_public.py - run this to clone all template repos in an org then make them public.

## You will need:
1. A GitHub classic personal access token with admin permissions for all orgs / repos you want to access with these scripts. Guidance: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
2. Add your GitHub access token to github.py.
3. For each of the scripts you want to run, edit so they point at your GitHub orgs instead of mine.
